            <h2>Abstract of the Project</h2>
        
        <p>The majority of heart illnesses can be diagnosed by analysing the ECG signal for arrhythmias. The PQRST waves in an 
            ECG signal represent one cardiac cycle. This suggested study addresses several methods and transformations that have 
            been previously described in the literature for analysing an ECG signal and extracting features from an arrhythmia 
            analysis. Cardiologists must manually identify different ECG heart-beat classes, which takes time and effort. On 
            computer-based techniques for classifying these heart diseases. A proposed taxonomy based on dichotomies involving 
            full time series-based versus feature-based, AAMI versus Non-AAMI, and inter-patient versus intra-patient based 
            distinctions is used in this work to organise the current research. This work's primary contributions are a comprehensive 
            evaluation of the literature on the detection of irregular heartbeats and the identification of relevant research</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-contribution">
            <h2>My Contribution:</h2>
            <p>The conventional techniques might not achieve efficient results 
            due to the inter-patient variability in ECG signals. Additionally, the efficiency 
            and accuracy of traditional methods could be negatively affected by the 
            increasing size of data. The techniques presented in literature have been 
            applied to smaller datasets however, for the purpose of generalization, the 
            performance should be tested on larger datasets. There are methods reported 
            that use 2-D ECG signals, however, to the best of our knowledge, there are 
            not clear details on how the 1-D ECG signal is converted to 2-D images for 
            using 2-D CNN models. Most methods have been tested on only a few types 
            of arrhythmia and must be evaluated on all major types of arrhythmia. It 
            should be noted that the performance of methods developed for 1-D ECG 
            signals can be further improved. Towards this end, the major contributions of 
            our proposed work are:
            1. Spectrograms (2-D images) are employed, which are generated 
            from the 1-D ECG signal using STFT. In addition, data augmentation was 
            used for the 2-D image representation of ECG signals.
            2. A state-of-the-art performance was achieved in ECG arrhythmia 
            classification by using the proposed CNN-based method with 2-D 
            spectrograms as input. </p>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Proposed Scheme</h2>
            <p>A schematic representation of the proposed scheme is presented in 
                Figure 1. The method consists of five steps, i.e., signal pre-processing, 
                generation of 2-D images (spectrograms), augmentation of data, extraction of 
                features from the data (using the CNN model), and its classification based on 
                the extracted features.</p>

            <h2>Experimental Investigations</h2>
            <p>In this project, we have deployed our training model using CNN on IBM 
                Watson studio and in our local machine. We are deploying 4 types of CNN 
                layers in a sequential manner starting from :</p> 
                <p>1. Convolutional layer 2D: A 2-D convolutional layer applies sliding 
                    convolutional filters to 2-D input. The layer convolves the input by moving 
                    the filters along the input vertically and horizontally and computing the dot 
                    product of the weights and the input, and then adding a bias term.</p> 
                <p>2. Pooling Layer: Pooling layers are used to reduce the dimensions of the 
                    feature maps. Thus, it reduces the number of parameters to learn and the 
                    amount of computation performed in the network. The pooling layer 
                    summarises the features present in a region of the feature map generated by a 
                    convolution layer</p>
                <p>3. Fully-Connected layer: After extracting features from multiple 
                    convolution layers and pooling layers, the fully connected layer is used to 
                    expand the connection of all features. Finally, the SoftMax layer makes a 
                    logistic regression classification. Fully-connected layer transfers the weighted 
                    sum of the output of the previous layer to the activation function. </p>
                <p>4. Dropout Layer: There is usually a dropout layer before the fully connected 
                    layer. The dropout layer will temporarily disconnect some neurons from the 
                    network according to the certain probability during the training of the 
                    convolution neural network, which reduces the joint adaptability between 
                    neuron nodes, reduces overfitting, and enhances the generalization ability of 
                    the network.
